The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music.

    "|            popularity | The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played more frequently now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played more frequently in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity are derived mathematically from track popularity. (integer) |\n",
